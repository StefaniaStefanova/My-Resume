Hey there! 👋 I'm Stefania, a Software Engineer who codes with a big smile and a love for solving problems. I'm not just about lines of code, but about creating fun, engaging, and scalable software solutions that make a difference. Whether it's automating tasks or designing the next great API, I’m here to make tech both fun and efficient. 😁

I believe code is more than just logic—it's an art form, a puzzle, and yes... a joke. If you can't explain your code without a puzzled look, something's off! 💡
